{"name":"Dom4","tagline":"a fully tested and covered polyfill for new DOM Level 4 entries","body":"DOM4\r\n====\r\n\r\nThis is a [fully tested](http://webreflection.github.io/dom4/test/) and covered polyfill for [new DOM Level 4 entries](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#interface-element)\r\n\r\n  * Element#prepend()\r\n  * Element#append()\r\n  * Element#before()\r\n  * Element#after()\r\n  * Element#replace()\r\n  * Element#remove()\r\n\r\nThe [implemented test](test/dom4.js) is conform to [current specifications](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#dom-rootnode-prepend).\r\n\r\nOther fixes/standardized behaviors include:\r\n\r\n  * [classList](http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#domtokenlist), with forced fixes for iOS 5.1 and Nokia ASHA Xpress Browser and early implementations\r\n  * [CustomEvent](http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#customevent) constructor for all browsers down to IE8\r\n  * [Element#matches](http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#dom-element-matches) utility to test elements against CSS selectors\r\n\r\nThe **DOM4** license is Mit Style.\r\n\r\nIf you need other polyfills too [have a look at another DOM-shim repo](https://github.com/Raynos/DOM-shim).\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\nTheoretically compatible with all browsers you know that are truly used these days, here a list:\r\n\r\n  * Android 2.1+\r\n  * Safari Mobile since iOS 3.0 and Desktop\r\n  * Opera Mobile, Mini, and Desktop\r\n  * Blackberry 7.1 and higher\r\n  * Samsung Bada 2 native Browser\r\n  * Midori and most likely all other WebKit based\r\n  * Chrome Mobile and Desktop\r\n  * Firefox Mobile and Desktop\r\n  * IE8+ for Desktop and IE Mobile 9 or greater.\r\n  * Nokia Xpress Browser for ASHA Platform\r\n  * Silk Browser - Fire OS 3.0\r\n  * PhantomJS can benefit from DOM4 too\r\n\r\nIt's way easier if you tell me which browser in a current relevant market share is not supported :-)\r\n\r\nFor **IE8** only it's recommended to include [ie8](https://github.com/WebReflection/ie8#ie8) script before `dom4` or `CustomEvent`, `addEventListener`, and `dispatchEvent` won't work as expected.\r\n\r\n### Which File\r\nThe [minified version is here](build/dom4.js), while the [max one here](build/dom4.max.js). If you want to test directly [try this page](http://webreflection.github.com/dom4/test/), it should be green.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
